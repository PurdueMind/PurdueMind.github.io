Our device will help these doctors perform the Dix-Hallpike by guiding them through the proper steps and angles required with the use of a headband, neck brace for the patient, and a small screen for the doctor. Our device will also check the eyes for nystagmus to diagnose BPPV. Once diagnosed, the doctor will use our device to perform the Epley maneuver to correct the vertigo."]
